Hello!

**We are excited to introduce Deab Labs**, We're building applications driven by LLMs to make fun experiences and enhance applications we use every day.

**LLMs are changing how humans interact with technology**. We want to contribute to this revolution by making things that excite us, and tackling the challenging technical and UX problems that these new interfaces present.

**We are a tight-knit team of builders** that has been building LLM-based apps together since before ChatGPT. We have the habits, experience and processes to iterate on ideas quickly, maintain focus on UX, and solve large-scale technical puzzles.

**Thank you for your interest in Deab Labs**. Contact us at [contact@deablabs.com](mailto:contact@deablabs.com) if you have any questions or would like to learn more about our work directly.

**Warm regards,**

_The Deab Labs Team_
