Cannoli is a no-code LLM scripting tool for everyone.

Cannoli can be used to build simple experiments or complex workflows, and you can learn pretty much everything you need to know to start building them in like 5 minutes.

Cannoli is built on top of [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), and allows the use of many LLM providers.

Cannoli is free to use through the Obsidian plugin store, and is open source under the MIT license.

Cannoli was nominated for the [Obsidian Gem of the Year](https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1i6jvu6/links_to_the_2024_obsidian_gem_nominations/) in 2024.

Check out the [Cannoli website](https://docs.cannoli.dev) to get started, or the [Github repo](https://github.com/deablabs/cannoli) to get the latest updates.
